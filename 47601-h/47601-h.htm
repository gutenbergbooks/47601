  <p>Grateful for the favourable reception the two preceding volumes of this work have met from the
  lovers of Natural History, it is with pleasure that I now present them, though late, with this my
  third and last volume, which has been completed in opposition to greater disadvantages and
  disappointments than attended either of the others.</p>

  <p>It may not be superfluous to inform my readers, that this publication is the result of such
  leisure hours only as could be spared from an indispensable assiduity to immediate business, and a
  necessary attention, at that time, to an impaired constitution.</p>

  <p>This being taken into consideration, little apology will be required for the length of time I
  have been in bringing it out, by those who know what trouble we must necessarily have with the
  various artists, who are employed in executing the different parts of such a work, and with what
  scrupulous exactness and care every minute part ought to be examined and corrected. This
  unavoidable delay, however, has been productive of another circumstance, which compels me to
  entreat all their candour and indulgence.</p>

  <p>I have always made it a rule of my conduct to promote Natural History by every method in my
  power. My cabinet has therefore been open to all those gentlemen, from whatever part of the world
  they came, who made Entomology their study. In consequence of this permission, descriptions of
  many of the insects now published have got abroad some time since, and even figures of several of
  them have made their appearance. This I did not expect, as many of my plates were entirely
  finished some months, and even years, before those above-mentioned could have got forth. This will
  account for the seeming contradiction in many places, upon comparing the descriptions with the
  Index, where many insects are described and mentioned as <i>new</i> ones, but in the Index have
  their synonyms given in various authors. The truth is, the descriptions were made about the year
  1775, between which time and the present those authors published their respective works.</p>

  <p>But who can foresee disappointments, or avoid their effects? It may be urged, that these plates
  might have been omitted, and others substituted. In so doing, however, I could <span
  class="pagenum" id="pageiv">{iv}</span>not have been justified, either to the purchasers of the
  former volumes, or to myself. Many of them, there is no doubt, would not have the figures of those
  insects alluded to, unless in this work; and, as to my part, without considering the loss, neither
  my business, my health, nor my leisure, would have enabled me to supply their place. This very
  circumstance I have mentioned in the Preface to my last volume, wherein I bespoke the candour of
  my readers for an <i>anticipation</i> of a similar kind, which got abroad before I could bring out
  that volume. In the present case, I have the greatest reason to request the same indulgence from a
  motive still stronger, which is, that almost all the figures given by other authors, and which I
  have quoted in the index, were taken from specimens originally in my possession. As it is, I hope,
  the novelty, the beauty, and the curiosity of the other insects herein published, will, by
  affording large gratification to the inquisitive naturalist, make some amends, and that the nature
  of my situation will procure me a full acquittal from any kind of premeditated imposition.</p>

  <p>In regard to the manners and economy of the insects now published, I have been able to get
  little information. There are very few, even of those who collect abroad, who will give themselves
  the trouble of making observations; and such as do not want inclination or ability, and even
  travel expressly for the purpose, find great, and to us almost inconceivable impediments.</p>

  <p>Mr. Smeathman, who has been many years in Africa and the West Indies, has furnished me with a
  few remarks on this subject, together with observations on some particular insects, published in
  the preceding volumes as well as this. These observations, I am of opinion, will afford
  information and entertainment to my readers, and, at the same time, throw some light on the
  nature, qualities, or dispositions of many kinds of insects, of which, hitherto, we know nothing
  more than the external figure. He informs me, that in hot climates, especially such as are not
  well settled, the difficulties attending every kind of study, and every species of collecting, are
  infinitely greater than those who have not visited them can possibly suppose. In those countries,
  either from the scarcity and high price of the materials, or the dearness of labour, the traders
  or settlers are obliged to calculate for little more than necessary house-room, with such
  conveniences only as are absolutely necessary for their different occupations and pursuits; in
  which they are, from these circumstances, frequently much cramped and embarrassed. If this is the
  case with those who have all the best means in their power of providing for themselves, how must
  it be with transient persons and speculative travellers, who are seldom profitable visitors, and
  whose studies consequently meet with little partiality from such as are assiduously engaged in the
  sole pursuit of wealth or power?</p>

  <p>As to the breeding of insects, and observing their changes and dispositions with care and
  circumspection, it seems almost impossible in the nature of things to be practised, except,
  comparatively speaking, with a very few.</p>

  <p>(The ravages of the tropical ants and cock-roaches are then detailed from the <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagev">{v}</span>information given by Mr. Smeathman, which I have thought it
  more interesting to introduce with the descriptions of those insects in the second volume.)</p>

  <p>The <i>termites</i> are another genus of insects, which some time or other injure the
  traveller, and at least add to the number of his cares. These wonderful creatures were little
  known till Mr. Smeathman developed their extraordinary history. They were generally supposed to be
  a species of ant, and in consequence so frequently confounded with the natural history of that
  great genus of insects, that it has thrown much obscurity into both.</p>

  <p>The ravages of these insects are so insidious, that travellers frequently suffer irreparable
  damage before they are aware of them. When they are previously informed, the depredations of those
  insects may be greatly prevented; but constant care and caution are required, which is no small
  addition to the number of cares that a collector must always have upon his mind. I shall not
  pretend to go any further into the history of this genus of insects, as I must necessarily borrow
  it from my ingenious friend's very entertaining account of them, published last year in the
  seventy-first volume, Part I. of the Philosophical Transactions, to which I refer my reader.</p>

  <p>To these obstacles, Mr. Smeathman adds others, some of which we can have little idea of in
  these climates. The <i>Norway rats</i> are so numerous and so bold, that they will come and feed
  by the side of the table at supper, and during the still hours of night, search every corner for
  plunder, making a continual uproar, and often, in a kind of furor, carry away small utensils, and
  other articles, which they can turn to no advantage either for food or shelter. They are very
  mischievous to the naturalist's collection of plants and seeds, tearing them and the books, in
  which they are kept, to pieces, as it were in wantonness, and carrying away such as are edible, in
  which they are often assisted by the land-crabs. These amphibious insects frequently make holes
  for themselves, or use those made by the rats under ground, and enter through the floors of the
  negroes' cottages.</p>

  <p>In the rainy seasons many small animals are apt to take shelter in the thatch; among others,
  <i>various species of snakes</i>, who most probably get there in pursuit of the rats. Mr.
  Smeathman when on the African shore observed, that the former were very harmless; and, as he found
  the latter very mischievous and destructive, he would not suffer the snakes to be killed or hunted
  out. The patient natives there, it seems, as well as the rational travellers, are not without
  consolation amidst this heterogeneous crowd of inmates. They see with pleasure the spiders always
  on the watch for the wasps and cock-roaches, the last of which are intolerable. The
  <i>lizards</i>, again, attack all sorts of insects, the large Tarantula, as it is called, not
  excepted. The lizards not unfrequently fall a prey to the <i>fowls</i>, and the rats to the
  snakes. Hence lizards, rats, snakes, and land-crabs occasionally serve as delicious repasts to the
  improvident inhabitants, who thus "thrive under evil."</p>

  <p>Sometimes indeed the land-crab becomes, as in the West Indies, a part of the stock of the
  provident and luxurious inhabitants, who inclose a small piece of ground in the manner <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagevi">{vi}</span>of a yard, and feed them with fruit, herbs, Indian corn,
  and other grain, on which they fatten exceedingly, and stewed in any manner are most delicious
  eating.</p>

  <p>Thus a speculative man can find few opportunities of securing his collections, or of making
  observations, while surrounded by the hospitable chief, the trader, the planter, and their
  families, who scarce finding room enough in their houses for themselves, think all time lost that
  is not spent in lucrative business, active pleasures, or social festivity. If to this we add
  frequent sickness, the want of boats or cattle for conveyance in cases where moving without is
  impracticable; the want of information, of guides, of assistance, the means of transporting
  things, of candlelights, or even a table to write on, it will not be surprising we have so little
  knowledge of the uncultivated tropical regions. Even travellers, who go expressly to make
  observations, have other great difficulties to encounter. They are sometimes obliged to pass much
  of their time in providing the mere necessaries of life, and some in securing themselves from
  danger, while their industry is always exposed to the avarice, the neglect, or the ill-will of
  ignorant people, whose services, though poor, are not to be easily dispensed with.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the cottages have no windows, and the larger houses, which they contrive to form in
  such manner as to receive the breezes, are generally without glass; so that the student frequently
  has his subject, his pen, or his paper blown away, with various other disappointments and
  vexations too numerous and too trivial to mention, but altogether distressing, and in many
  instances insurmountable.</p>

  <p>As this is the case, we have not much reason to wonder that our accounts of some foreign
  countries, and their natural productions, are so short and imperfect. We must content ourselves
  with slight sketches, which, repeated and corroborated by various travellers, may at last amount
  to one great descriptive and useful work, of which those contained in this Preface are offered
  only as so many scattered seeds.</p>

  <p>(The various observations upon the economy of different species figured in these Illustrations,
  and inserted in this Preface, have been respectively introduced under the species to which they
  belonged.)</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page2">{2}</span></div>

  <p>This magnificent butterfly is so exceedingly rare that M. Boisduval, whose knowledge of the
  European Collections is very extensive, questions whether there exists any other specimen than
  that originally figured by Drury. Mr. Jones also, whose splendid Collection of Drawings are so
  frequently quoted by Fabricius, copied this insect, figuring both the upper and under sides, which
  figures have been lately published by Mr. Donovan in his Naturalist's Repository. Mr. Donovan also
  adds, that from the manuscripts of Mr. Drury, "we find that he received this insect in 1775, from
  Mr. Smeathman, an assiduous and very intelligent naturalist stationed at Sierra Leone."</p>

  <p>"From the observations of Mr. Smeathman it may be imagined that this insect is not unfrequent
  in that particular part of Africa, but that its capture is attended with considerable difficulty,
  as well from the manner of its flight, as the time when it appears on the wing; it is seen only in
  mid-day, when every exertion under the direct influence of a vertical sun must be painful to an
  European. Its flight is also remarkable for its velocity, and to increase the difficulty of taking
  it, the insect frequents only the upper branches of the trees, from whence it darts and glances
  from one branch to another, and never descends nearer to the ground than the height of eight feet.
  Mr. Smeathman observes also, that it turns its head about instantly to the glade or path, and will
  not suffer any person to approach within 'striking distance' of it, but will dart away on the
  least motion of the body; if the naturalist however exerts his patience, it will at last become
  more familiar and careless, and is then to be caught upon some particular branch, to which it will
  appear more attached than to another."</p>

  <p class="sp3">Mr. Donovan however suggests, that the insect must be not only exceedingly local,
  but also of great rarity.</p>

  towards sunset in great crowds to particular bushes. They breed chiefly in recent plantations, and
  near towns in general, so that, comparatively speaking, few of them are found in the ancient
  forests. Such however as inhabit them fly about the tops of the highest trees, seeking the honey
  from their flowers, and are seldom seen below.</p>

    other part of the wings. Posterior wings cream-coloured, verged along the external edges with
    black, whereon is a row of white spots, and above it a row of small and very faint red ones:
    these wings next the body have a patch of a deep black, spotted with white, and verged with
    faint orange, and also several black spots.</p>

  figured by Drury. As the former species had the priority in point of date, Fabricius, in the
  alphabetical index to that work, altered the name of Drury's insect to Epistrophus. By the
  establishment, however, of the genus Morpho, comprising the insect figured by Drury, the
  difficulty is obviated, and as the species is universally known under the name of Laertes, it does
  not appear requisite to adopt the name of Epistrophus.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Drury referred this insect to the then unpublished Papilio Hydaspes, on the
  authority of Fabricius's handwriting, (his specimen having most probably been thus labelled by
  that author.) The authors of the Encyclopédie Méthodique also cite Drury's figure under Hydaspes.
  Fabricius, however, cites only the Banksian Cabinet, and Mr. Donovan's figure taken from the
  Banksian specimen, and published in the Naturalist's Repository, Vol. 2. Pl. 60. convinces us that
  Drury's insect is specifically distinct from that described by Fabricius, although evidently
  identical with the insect described as Hydaspes in the Encyclopédie Méthodique. Under these
  circumstances I have considered it most advisable to retain the name of Hydaspes for Drury's
  insect, under which name it was known for the space of ten years before the publication of the
  Fabrician Hydaspes, to which a new specific name must be applied. As there are several other
  nearly allied Brazilian species, it is not impossible that Fabricius, from recollection alone,
  applied the name of Hydaspes to Drury's specimen, having previously described the insect from the
  Banksian Cabinet, the under surface of which especially is very different from that figured by
  Donovan.</p>

  <p>The transformations of this curious species have been figured by Stoll in his supplementary

  of the same colour. The head is black, with two yellow spots, and furnished with two short obtuse
  spines. It lives upon a plant called "poirvier," feeding <span class="pagenum"
  id="page22">{22}</span>only by night, remaining during the day concealed in a kind of case, which
  it forms by rolling up a leaf. The chrysalis is short, and thick, without angular prominences, of
  a grey colour, with black dots. It attaches itself by the tail to the stem of the plant upon which
  it feeds.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This insect belongs to the subgenus Eudamus proposed by Mr. Swainson, in the new
  series of his beautiful Zoological Illustrations, and appears in no respect to differ from that
  which he has figured under the name of Eudamus Doryssus. He observes that the type of this group
  is the Hesperia Proteus Fabr.; that all the species, of which there are nearly thirty, are from
  America; that their flight is exceedingly rapid in the morning and evening, and that they rest
  with their wings perpendicular. Drury, on the other hand, gives Sierra Leone as the habitat, and
  adds, moreover, on the authority of Mr. Smeathman, that this species, like the last, sports in the
  sun, and is remarkable for the very rapid short flights it takes from bush to bush, so as to be
  caught with great difficulty. In his manuscripts, however, I find this species marked as being
  from "Madras, Mr. Skeene, 1772."</p>

    marks and spots, with a small faint blueish indented line running along the external
    borders.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The original Fabrician description of this insect is stated to have been derived
  from an insect from Cayenne in the collection of Mr. Yeats; and in the Fabrician detailed
  description, we find the wings characterized thus&mdash;"macula magna, <i>in medio</i>, fulva,
  anticæ subtus concolores." It appears, however, from the observations of Donovan that the
  celebrated iconographer Jones had made a drawing of Yeats's specimen, from which drawing Donovan
  published his illustration of the species in the Naturalist's Repository, with the following
  observations:&mdash;"There was a variety of this insect pretty nearly, but not exactly, according
  with this in the collection of an old and well-known entomologist, a figure of which appeared
  shortly after the publication of the Fabrician writings as the true Papilio <span class="pagenum"
  id="page34">{34}</span>Pyramus. It was not precisely the same as it appeared to us from an
  inspection of the specimen in the Cabinet of Mr. Drury." Making due allowance for Donovan's
  over-charged colouring, there is still considerable difference between the figures of Drury and
  Donovan; in the former the fore-wings being almost entirely red on the under side, whilst in the
  latter, the upper side of same wings is red, except at the tips. In both these particulars, as
  will at once be seen from the above quotation of Fabricius, Drury's figure perfectly agrees with
  the character given of Yeats's specimen; whilst Donovan's differs in each respect. The female of
  this species is destitute of the purple gloss on the upper surface of the wings, and the red band
  does not run into the posterior pair.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I have adopted the Fabrician specific name, notwithstanding its subsequent date,
  that proposed by Cramer being exceedingly inapplicable. Drury states, on the authority of Mr.
  Smeathman, that this curious insect was found on the island of Banana. Its flight is exceedingly
  slow, and its tails seem rather to impede it. Mr. Donovan states that several specimens of this
  insect had been received from Sierra Leone (which habitat is given by Drury in the body of his
  work, but corrected as above in the observations communicated to him by Mr. Smeathman) and that he
  is not aware of the species having occurred in any other part of Africa, neither had he understood
  that any other collector since Mr. Smeathman had met with the species. Of the original specimens a
  pair belonged to Mr. Drury, which came into the hands of Mr. Donovan, who also mentions a fine
  specimen as existing in the Banksian Cabinet at the Linnæan Society; adding, that some few other
  specimens passed into different continental Cabinets, all of which, however, were those collected
  by Mr. <span class="pagenum" id="page40">{40}</span>Smeathman. The late Mr. Haworth, however, (the
  sale of whose magnificent collection by public auction lasted for ten days,) possessed four
  specimens of this rare moth, a pair of which were purchased by W. Swainson, Esq., and the
  remaining pair by myself.</p>

    a light chocolate, which is separated from a dusky brown border running along the external edges
    by a white and orange band, which, being the chief colours on this side, are continued along the
    posterior wings. The base is adorned with black streaks, surrounded with white, placed along the
    anterior edges, and others of different forms on the middle of the wings. Along the external
    edges, on the dusky border, is placed a row of black triangular spots, which at the lower
    corners are doubled. Posterior wings of the same colour as the anterior, the chocolate ground
    having a number of small black marks and streaks, bordered with white, in a very irregular
    manner. At the lower corner is placed a dark grey eye, with a black iris and a white
    longitudinal streak in the centre, two rows of small black spots, some being edged with white,
    of different forms, are also placed along the dusky border.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I have ventured, on the authority of several distinguished entomologists, to give
  this insect as a species distinct from Goliathus maximus, figured in the first volume of these
  Illustrations, Pl. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47599/47599-h/47599-h.htm#plate31">31</a>.
  It is true, indeed, that both are from the tropical districts of the western coast of Africa, and
  that both exhibit the same general structure and form of the horns, (the variations of which
  constitute the chief specific differences in these cornuted species). Drury evidently at first
  regarded it as specifically distinct, for he says, in his observation upon it, "This insect is of
  the same genus with that described in Vol. 1. Pl. <a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47599/47599-h/47599-h.htm#plate31">XXXI</a>., but I judge it
  to be a different species," although in the synoptical appendix to the volume he calls it "a
  variety of Goliathus," the markings are very different, as may be seen by comparing the two
  figures; but it might be considered that the specimen represented in the first volume was a rubbed
  individual of that here figured; this, however, is evidently not the case, because in both
  descriptions Drury expressly describes the dark part of the elytra as resembling velvet, which
  could not be the case if the specimen was <span class="pagenum" id="page55">{55}</span>rubbed.
  Moreover, a very fine and recent specimen corresponding with the present figure has lately been
  received by Mr. Havill, of Oxford Street, printseller and naturalist, who has demanded the sum of
  fifty pounds for it. The individual here figured is in the collection of Mr. MacLeay, to whom I
  have been indebted for a sight of it, and by whose father it was purchased at the sale of Mr.
  Drury's collection at the price of £12. 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, forming lot 95, in the first day's
  sale, Thursday May 23, 1805, and described in the catalogue as "Scarabæus Goliathus, var." I have
  also seen in the Royal Museum at Berlin a female of this genus having the head unarmed, and
  agreeing in colour and markings with the insect here figured, but which is regarded by Dr. Klug as
  a species distinct from the Goliath. maximus, and which he has recently described in Ermann's
  Voyage.</p>

  Drury Ins. . tab. . fig. ." It will be sufficient to observe that Drury has described no such
  insect, although it is probable that Fabricius, who was on terms of intimacy with our author,
  might have seen the unpublished figure of such insect in his possession. Mr. Smeathman informed
  our author that he was once stung in the finger by one of these insects, but the pain was not so
  severe as might have been expected from a wound made by so large a creature belonging to this
  genus. His method, when stung by any insects in Africa, was to open the puncture with a lancet,
  and squeeze out the blood and venom together, which, when effectually done, soon caused the pain
  to abate.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I have attached a mark of doubt to all the synonyms quoted above, 1st. on account
  of the difference of locality between Drury's Insect, and that described by Fabricius, which is
  from New Holland. 2ndly. Because Drury's description does not agree with the true Rh. mystacina:
  and 3dly. because as there is another spotted species of the genus found in North America,
  described by Laporte, it is most probable that Drury's insect is altogether distinct, in which
  case I have proposed for it the name of Rhipicera Druræi. Mr. Kirby speaks of the New Holland
  species of this genus as though there were more than one, and he has described one from that
  country under the name of R. femorata, in the 12th volume of the Linn. Trans. No. 9. in which the
  thorax, as well as the elytra, is spotted with white, whereas the thorax of Mystacina is described
  by Fabricius as being "cinereus." The Rh. mystacina of Laporte entirely agrees with Mr. Kirby's
  Rh. femorata. The Rh. femorata of Dalman is a totally distinct species from Brazil, and as it is
  necessary that a new specific name should be given to it, I would suggest that it should be termed
  Rh. Dalmanni.</p>

    pointed and black horns that are placed directly over the eyes, and two smaller ones a little
    below them. It appears as if it had four eyes; two fixed, and of a grey colour like horn; just
    below which the other two (seeming eyes) are placed. They are black and moveable, but are the
    antennæ, and are perfectly round. Hemelytra dirty green at the base, with some dusky red patches
    irregularly placed; but near the extremity having a large patch of a dark orange colour. The
    wings are black, but next the body red, with some red spots in the centre of them. Rostrum
    horny, lying between the legs, even with and close to the breast. Tongue seeming to proceed from
    the mouth, and much smaller than the other instrument (labium), being as small and fine as a
    hair. Feet formed for walking.</p>

  <p>There is a confusion in the works of the earlier authors relative to the native country of this
  species; Linnæus and Fabricius stating it to be India, whilst Stoll records Surinam, Drury,
  Cayenne, during that it and others figured by him were collected by Mons. Mallouet, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page79">{79}</span>who sent them to Europe, but in their passage they were
  taken by the Shaftesbury privateer, and afterwards sold by public auction, where he purchased
  them. Donovan states that two specimens he possessed were taken in Brazil; and Dr. Burmeister
  still more satisfactorily says, "Gleichfalls aus <i>Sud-Amerika</i> findet sich besonders haufig
  auf den Cautschuck-Baumen (Siphonia elastica)."</p>
